  <p>Ralstonia solanacearum is an aerobic non-spore-forming, Gram-negative, plant pathogenic bacterium.</p>
  <p>R. solanacearum is soil-borne and motile with a polar flagellar tuft. <br>It colonises the xylem, causing bacterial wilt in a very wide range of potential host plants. <br>It is known as Granville wilt when it occurs in tobacco. <br>Bacterial wilts of tomato, pepper, eggplant, and Irish potato caused by R. solanacearum were among the first diseases that Erwin Frink Smith proved to be caused by a bacterial pathogen. Because of its devastating lethality, R. solanacearum is now one of the more intensively studied phytopathogenic bacteria, and bacterial wilt of tomato is a model system for investigating mechanisms of pathogenesis.Ralstonia was recently reclassified as Pseudomonas, with similarity in most aspects, except that it does not produce fluorescent pigment like Pseudomonas.</p>
  <p>The genomes from different strains vary from 5.5 Mb up to 6 Mb, roughly being 3.5 Mb of a chromosome and 2 Mb of a megaplasmid. While the strain GMI1000 was one of the first phytopathogenic bacterias to have its genome completed, the strain UY031 was the first R. solanacearum to have its methylome reported. Within the R. solanacearum species complex, the four major monophyletic clusters of strains are termed phylotypes, that are geographically distinct: phylotypes I-IV are found in Asia, the Americas, Africa, and Oceania, respectively.</p>
