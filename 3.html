  <h2><u>Disease cycle</u></h2>
  <p>
  <strong>Survival</strong>
  <br>
  Ralstonia solanacearum can overwinter in plant debris or diseased plants, wild hosts, seeds, or vegetative propagative organs like tubers. The bacteria can survive for a long time in water (up to 40 years at 20–25 °C in pure water), and the bacterial population is reduced in extreme conditions (temperature, pH, salts, e.g.). Infected land sometimes cannot be used again for susceptible crops for several years. R. solanacearum can also survive in cool weather and enter a state of being viable but not culturable. In most cases, this stage is not an agricultural threat because the bacteria usually become avirulent after recovering.

  <strong>Dispersal</strong>
  <br>
  Ralstonia solanacearum causes wilting at high populations (108 – 1010 cfu/g tissue) and disperses in several routes. The large number of R. solanacearum can shed from roots of symptomatic and nonsymptomatic plants. Besides that, bacterial ooze (which is usually used as a sign for detection) on plant surfaces) can enter the surrounding soil or water, contaminating farming equipment or may be acquired by insect vectors. In addition, this pathogen can be spread by contaminated flood water, irrigation, contaminated tools, or infected seeds. In northern Europe, the pathogen has become established in solanaceous weeds which grow in slow-moving rivers. When such contaminated water is used to irrigate potatoes, the pathogen enters the potato production system. The race 3 biovar 2 strain can survive in perennial nightshades which act as secondary hosts, and can also cause bacterial wilt of tomato. Some EU states and Middle Eastern countries have not yet been able to eradicate this pathogen.

  <strong>Infection</strong>
  <br>
  Ralstonia solanacearum usually enters the plant by a wound. Natural wounds (created by abscission of flowers, genesis of lateral roots) and unnatural ones (by agricultural practices or nematodes and xylem-feeding insects) could become entry sites for R. solanacearum. The bacteria get access to the wounds partially by flagellar-mediated swimming motility and chemotaxic attraction toward root exudates. Unlike many phytopathogenic bacteria, R. solanacearum potentially requires only one entry site to establish a systemic infection that results in bacterial wilt.
  <br>
  After invading a susceptible host, R. solanacearum multiplies and moves systemically within the plant before bacterial wilt symptoms occur. Wilting should be considered as the most visible side effect that usually occurs after extensive colonization of the pathogen. When the pathogen gets into the xylem through natural openings or wounds, tyloses may form to block the axial migration of bacteria within the plant. In susceptible plants, this sometimes happens slowly and infrequently to prevent pathogen migration, and may instead lead to vascular dysfunction by unspecifically obstructing uncolonized vessels.[clarification needed]
  <br>
  Wilting occurs at high bacterial populations in the xylem and is partially due to vascular dysfunction in which sufficient water cannot reach the leaves. At this time, extracellular polysaccharide (EPS1) content is about 10 μg/g tissue in the taproot, hypocotyl, and midstem; EPS1 concentration is higher later on at more than 100 μg/g tissue in fully wilted plant. Ralstonia's systemic toxin also causes loss of stomatal control, but no evidence shows excessive transpiration as its consequence. The primary factor contributing to wilting is probably blocking of pit membranes in the petioles and leaves by the high molecular weight EPS1. High bacterial densities are byproducts of plant cell wall degradation; tyloses and gums produced by the plant itself are other contributing factors to wilting
