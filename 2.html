  <p>
  <strong>Hosts</strong>
  <br>
  Plant hosts that R. solanacearum infects include:
  </p>
  <p>
  <strong>Crops</strong>
  <br>
  Potato (Solanum tuberosum); tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum); aubergine (egg plant) (Solanum melongena); banana, (Musa spp); geranium (common name) (Pelargonium); ginger (Zingiber officinale); tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum); sweet pepper (Capsicum spp.); olive (Olea europea); rose (Rosa); and soybean (Glycine max).

  <strong>Symptoms</strong>
  <br>
  Geranium
  Wilting begins with lower leaves and petioles and works its way up the plant.
  Wilted leaves have chlorotic, wedge-shaped areas or chlorotic and/or necrotic leaf margins. No leaf spots are evident.
  Eventually, the entire plant collapses on the medium.
  White runny material oozes from cut stems.

  <strong>Potato</strong>
  <br>
  Wilting of the leaves occurs at the end of the day with recovery at night. Plants eventually fail to recover and die.
  Brown staining of vascular ring happens and pus may exude from the ring when the tuber is squeezed.
  Pale ooze may exude from eyes and heel end of potato. Soil will adhere to the oozing eyes.
  Cross-section of a stem placed in water will exude milky white strands.
  Unlike the fungal wilts, the leaves remains green in bacterial wilt.
